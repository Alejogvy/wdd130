        <p>"Ecuador is a country that straddles the equator on the west coast of South America. Its diverse landscapes encompass 
            the Amazon jungle, the Andean highlands and the Galapagos Islands with abundant fauna. On the slopes of the Andes, 
            at an elevation of 2,850 m, its capital Quito is famous for its long-preserved Spanish colonial center, with ornate 
            16th and 17th century palaces and religious sites, such as the ornate Church of the Company of Jesus." - wiki</p>
